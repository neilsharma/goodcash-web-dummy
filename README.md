This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
## Environment Variables

This project utilizes the Vercel CLI to conveniently pull environment variables from the Vercel hosting environment.

To access environment variables using the Vercel CLI, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the Vercel CLI installed. If not, you can install it globally using npm: ```npm install -g vercel``` or yarn: ```yarn global add vercel```
2. Make sure you are logged in with vercel account and linked your local directory with it. (It will prompt you to login into vercel account when you run `yarn dev` script).
3. You may have to change the selected project in vercel cli to `goodcash-web` using `vercel switch` command. For more information please refer to [https://vercel.com/docs/cli](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
